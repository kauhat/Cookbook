# Curried meatballs 

## Ingredients

* 800 g – 1 kilo of lean mince lamb
* 2 fresh green or red chillies
* 2 – 3 inch piece peeled root ginger – finely grated or chopped
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 2 teaspoons garam masala
* 1 large pot of natural/ Greek yoghurt or Greek yoghurt with coconut 

## Method

### Meatballs

* Finely chop peeled ginger and chillies and add to minced lamb .
* Mix half of garam masala plus the other spices with 2 table spoons of yoghurt and add to lamb mix.
* Mix well with wooden spoon and finally with your hands.
* Wet hands and form meat mix into small compact balls. Do not make the meatballs too large, try to keep them all the same size. 

*Remember, wet hands make smooth balls.*

### Sauce

Place large saucepan on stove and add the rest of the yoghurt then mix it with the rest of the garam masala. When spices and yoghurt are well mixed, add a cup of water and bring to the boil.

### Cooking

* Gently place the meat balls in the saucepan and bring back to he boil.
* Make sure all meatballs are covered in liquid; add more water if necessary.
* Turn down the heat so they are gently simmering.  Put a lid on the saucepan if you have one.
* After 10 - 15 mins turn meat balls over.  If you have two layers of meatballs, move the lower ones to the top and put the top ones at the bottom!
* Cook for another 10 - 15 minutes then reduce the liquid by removing the lid and turning up the heat.
* When the sauce looks like sauce not just wet stuff, remove from heat and serve with rice.
